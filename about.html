        <h2>About Buildframe</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kymodeus a fellow tenno that plays Warframe and really enjoys the game. I enjoy the game so much that I made this
            webtool for myself and others to compare different builds for their Warframes, Companions, Weapons, and others. I enjoy
            making websites and webtools in my free time when I'm not grinding Warframe. If you have any questions, suggestions, feedback
            or you just want to say hi feel free to reach out via my discord @kymodeus. I hope you find Buildframe useful 
            and enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it!
        </p><br>
        
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stat Comparison:</strong> Compare different builds side-by-side to see which one suits your playstyle best.</li>
            <li><strong>Save & Share (coming soon):</strong> Save your builds for future reference and share them with friends or the wider community.</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>First up you have to enter your stat names at the middle to declare and keep track of which stats are you comparing. 
            Name both of your builds at the top of each build card. Then enter the stat values for each build in the respective 
            input fields. As you enter the values, the comparison indicators in the middle will update in real-time to show 
            which build has higher stats for each category.
